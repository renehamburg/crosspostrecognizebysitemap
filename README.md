# crosspostrecognizebysitemap
This script was created by me because I had no clue how to post new posts automatically e.g. on Mastodon.
It detects changes in the sitemap.xml and creates a toot (or whatever you like to do with a Title and URL).

## setup
Just modify the URL-part in the script an run it by cron every 24h at 10 (0 10 * * *  crosspost.sh)
